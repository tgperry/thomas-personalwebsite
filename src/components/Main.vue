        <h1 class="about-title">About Me</h1>
        <p class="about">I currently work at Starbucks as a Technical Product Manager in the Seattle Starbucks Support Center. Working in Starbucks' technology division has allowed me to work on challenging projects leveraging unique and exciting software with a guarantee that no two days will be the same. My experience in jobs, education, and general life has consistently involved creativity, motivation, and high spirits. In my free time I 
work on personal web and mobile app projects, my culinary and espresso brewing skills, and getting outdoors whenever I can. Thank you for visiting my website, I hope it gives you a 
little better of an idea about myself! If you ever wish to contact me, please do not hesitate from using any of the methods above, I would be happy to hear from you to chat about anything.</p>     

        <h1 class="experience-title">Experience</h1>
        <p class="experience">It has been an incredible privilege to work for the following companies and collaborate with teams that have helped me grow into the person and professional I am today. I owe it to these coworkers in the same way I owe it to my teachers and professors for giving me the mentorship and guidance to grow and get better at what I love to do.</p>

        <p class="job">Technical Product Manager<br>May 2024 - Present</p>
        <p class="description">
            As a Technical Product Manager (TPM) at Starbucks, my mission is to take an idea from the product team, work with design on a vision, and translate that design into technical requirements that myself and my engineering team can then bring to life. So far, my time at Starbucks can be broken down into two distinct projects: the transformation of the Product API from REST into GraphQL and supporting the progress
            of the Digital Menu Board effort. I was initially brought aboard for the former, but once we got the project off the ground and into a maintenance mode, I transferred over to the latter as it is one of the company's top technical objectives and investments. Leveraging GraphQL helped us synthesize a variety of different, but well organized microservices into a single API endpoint capable of delivering precise product data payloads
            based on the consumer's request. The Digital Menu Board project is an ongoing effort to transform print menus that you would see behind the counter of a Starbucks cafe into digital menus, capable of rendering dynamic content based on the desires of creative personnel.

        <p class="job">Senior Software Engineering Consultant<br>July 2022 - May 2024</p>
        <p class="description">
            The intersection of business and technology is where I find that I thrive and my work as a solutions consultant with Credera put me right in that sweet spot. My general responsibilities were to engage with business leaders and translate complex ideas into technical requirements that myself and a development team could turn into reality.
            My primary technical skills leveraged in this role were full stack development with expertise in API development (Spring, Java) and analytics implementations (Google Analytics), although the nature of the job required me to pick up new and diverse technologies quickly in order to meet the needs of the client. One of the most educational, challenging, and
            entertaining parts of the job was diving into how different companies ran their software teams and platforms. I believe the privilege of this experience helped me understand what "works" and what doesn't for companies with both large (public, millions of users) and small (internal, hundreds of users) software platforms.

        <p class="job">Software Engineering Intern (Agriculture Group, GNSS Group)<br>May 2020 - December 2020</p>
        <p class="description">
            I designed and developed the “Vehicle Sync” platform to support collaborative farming among operators in real time using Vue.js, HTML, CSS, Java. Vehicle Sync is a web application served using Android Webview, and I therefore got some experience working in the Android environment and specifically Android Studio. 
            I also developed a GNSS Logging tool to automate issue diagnostics related to in-field satellite disconnects. This project is very similar to what I did with PACCAR, however Trimble's technologies and data storage methods are proprietary, so I was working with reduced documentation. I believe this makes the project a very fun challenge.

            Aside from having an amazing time, gaining a deeper appreciation for the Spanish culture and language, traveling to places all over, and making lifelong friends, I had the incredible honor to collaborate with a group of very intelligent computer science students to develop a decentralized, person to person chat application using SOLID, a web technology under development by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. During that time, I even had the remarkable experience of communicating with Sir Berners-Lee over the SOLID chat room on Gitter. What an incredible experience to place the cherry on top of one of the best times of my life. I cannot wait to travel back to Asturias and see my friends there again.

        <h1 class="design-title">Design Work</h1>
        <p class="design">Since I was a kid I have been very interested in design and art of all mediums. I have had the privilege of visiting art museums all over the world, always making a point to do so on my travels, but my favorite of all time 
            is in my hometown, the Seattle Art Museum. The second semester of my junior year at Mines, I was able to take part in a special topics class on the history of art and its relation to the environment. Taking that class further solidified my belief
            in the connection between art, environment, and computer science. The elegance and sentient nature of code exhibits a unique and interpretive beauty that I am personally enraptured in. But I digress, here are some logos that I have created as I explore my
            own abilities in the realm of artwork and design. All of these were done using the Adobe Creative Cloud suite. I also did a lot of the art for the indie games I have developed that are linked at the top of this screen, but I cannot take away credit from my
            incredible teammate and great friend who I worked with on those games and who led the way for a lot of the design, Tyler Zudans.

        <p class="projects">Currently, I am holding a role at Starbucks as a Technical Product Manager and working on some side projects. Without giving away too much, my side projects include a website that serves video and audio content based on a user's preferences and a machine learning tool that transcribes lectures into
            organized notes. Stay tuned for the results of these projects, as they're sure to be linked here. Wish me luck and know that I'm wishing you the same in all of your endeavors! Here's a neat quote for your motivation:

Good luck and have fun!
